<p>Turning logistics insights into data-driven decisions

Hi there! I'm currently a Transportation Analyst with almost 2 years of experience at Amazon, where I managed complex logistics operations across Europe, optimized asset movements, and identified process inefficiencies using data. Now, I’m on a journey to become a Business/Data Analyst — blending my operations background with technical skills in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python.

🔍 What I bring:
📦 Real-world logistics data experience

📊 KPI dashboards and performance tracking

🔄 Process optimization through data analysis

🧮 Hands-on with Excel, SQL, Power BI & Python (pandas, matplotlib)

🚀 Projects (in progress or completed):
📈 Transportation Cost Optimization Dashboard – Built using Power BI

🗃️ Shipment Delay Analysis – Python + Excel project on delay trends

📊 Amazon Empty Asset Movement Case Study – Operational insights + mock analysis

🧰 SQL Portfolio – Sample queries from mock logistics datasets

📚 Currently learning:
Advanced Power BI (DAX & visuals)

Python for data storytelling

Real-world business case analysis

🎯 Goal:
To land a Business Analyst or BI Analyst role where I can turn operational data into strategic insights.</p>
